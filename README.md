* To get the info needed responses in the right spot in the response column just assign them all an info needed value, and have it so a function checks, say after a five second delay after the button click function executes, and automatically sorts responses to the right column. Everything else can stay the same. That way when I'm done with the logic flow I can have all the info already in the right spot to do useful stuff like create sheets of needed info or summaries. They come into the list already with the option to delete button already there.
* At some point change it so you can't do duplicate entries too. You could have the secondary function also search responses and delete any duplicates. That is an effective way to do it too.

* Also, as far as how you're doing the buttons. Another way to do it might be frames. I've never worked with frames before, but if each button could just be on the equivalent of a card that could be put at the bottom as next or removed that could be a better approach than showing and hiding html buttons, cuz I have a strong suspicion I'm gonna run into the having to duplicate buttons to get them in right order sequence again without big gaps of space. Or, you could put a size value to each button, and then just expand or collapse them, that likely would be easier.

* First finish putting in the logic flow. Assign values as needed with the 'let' variable and then just do if else if and nesting as needed.
