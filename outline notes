Will Outline Notes

1. Do complete outline
2. then get all the current citations and verbiage and links to everything
3. write the buttons and divs
4. Write the script for the logic flow. This one try assigning variables and do it that way instead of twenty million different re-written buttons and divs for each re-occurrence of the same question to get the order of appearance of div responses right
5. Get this to work on iphones and Macs too, different screen sizes and Android too, confirm on it

On this one sort how to make visible all questions or invisible all questions on button click, 
Have a copy option for that, and for the answers, where you can just click a spot of text and it copies like they have it on Amazon Turk for your worker number. Add in for to be able to scroll on columns, figure that out.
